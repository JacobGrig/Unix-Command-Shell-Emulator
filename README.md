# Unix-Command-Shell-Emulator
This is a simplified version of Unix Command Shell which I wrote in 2016 as a part of a computer workshop.

Available operations:
- conveyor (|)
- I/O redirection (<, >, >>)
- background execution (&)
- sequential execution (;)
- logical operators (&&, ||)

You can use whatever shell commands you want with them.

Not available:
- loops
- if-statements
- etc.

I also reimplemented some shell commands (cp, tail, wc -> mcp, mtail, mwc).
